# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WebContainer Babel Modernization enhances the existing RunJS Local + AI application with comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript transpilation capabilities using Babel. This feature provides automatic language detection, modern syntax support (ESNext to ES5), auto-execution on file changes, and extensible plugin architecture for future framework support (React, Solid, Vue). The enhancement focuses on creating a robust, configurable transpilation pipeline that seamlessly integrates with the existing WebContainer execution environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic language detection and transpilation for JavaScript/TypeScript files, so that I can write modern syntax without worrying about compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create or open a file with .js, .mjs, .ts, or .tsx extension THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the language type
2. WHEN I write modern JavaScript syntax (ESNext, ES2022, etc.) THEN the system SHALL transpile it to the target environment using Babel
3. WHEN I use TypeScript syntax THEN the system SHALL transpile TypeScript to JavaScript with proper type checking
4. WHEN I use advanced features (decorators, class properties, optional chaining, top-level await) THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly through appropriate Babel plugins
5. WHEN transpilation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with line numbers and suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Babel preset and plugin support, so that I can use any JavaScript/TypeScript feature or framework syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL configure @babel/preset-env with optimal settings for WebContainer environment
2. WHEN I use TypeScript THEN the system SHALL apply @babel/preset-typescript with proper configuration
3. WHEN I use modern syntax features THEN the system SHALL automatically include necessary transform plugins (class-properties, optional-chaining, nullish-coalescing, etc.)
4. WHEN I need framework support THEN the system SHALL support adding React, Solid, Vue, and other framework presets
5. WHEN I configure custom Babel settings THEN the system SHALL respect .babelrc, babel.config.js, or package.json babel configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want auto-execution of code when I make changes, so that I can see results immediately without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify code in the editor THEN the system SHALL detect changes and trigger auto-execution after a configurable delay
2. WHEN auto-execution is triggered THEN the system SHALL transpile the code first, then execute it in WebContainer
3. WHEN I enable/disable auto-execution THEN the system SHALL respect my preference and provide manual execution option
4. WHEN execution is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and allow cancellation
5. WHEN auto-execution encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display them without interrupting the editing experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimal WebContainer configuration for modern JavaScript execution, so that my code runs efficiently with all necessary dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebContainer initializes THEN the system SHALL create an optimal package.json with Babel dependencies and modern Node.js configuration
2. WHEN I use npm packages THEN the system SHALL automatically install dependencies and configure them for the transpilation pipeline
3. WHEN I run transpiled code THEN the system SHALL execute it with proper module resolution and import/export support
4. WHEN I use different module formats (ESM, CommonJS) THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly through Babel configuration
5. WHEN WebContainer starts THEN the system SHALL configure it with appropriate Node.js version and feature flags

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible plugin architecture for future framework support, so that I can easily add React, Solid, Vue, or other framework capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to add framework support THEN the system SHALL provide a simple configuration interface to enable framework presets
2. WHEN I enable React support THEN the system SHALL automatically configure @babel/preset-react with JSX transformation
3. WHEN I enable TypeScript + React THEN the system SHALL configure both presets to work together seamlessly
4. WHEN I add custom Babel plugins THEN the system SHALL integrate them into the transpilation pipeline
5. WHEN framework presets are added THEN the system SHALL update the WebContainer environment with necessary dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging support, so that I can quickly identify and fix transpilation or execution issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Babel transpilation fails THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages with file location and syntax suggestions
2. WHEN runtime execution fails THEN the system SHALL map errors back to original source code using source maps
3. WHEN I encounter dependency issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on missing packages or configuration
4. WHEN transpilation is slow THEN the system SHALL provide performance insights and optimization suggestions
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support source map generation for accurate debugging experience

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable transpilation settings, so that I can customize the build process for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need custom target environments THEN the system SHALL allow configuring browserslist or Node.js version targets
2. WHEN I want specific Babel options THEN the system SHALL support loose mode, spec compliance, and other preset options
3. WHEN I need performance optimization THEN the system SHALL provide options for caching, incremental compilation, and parallel processing
4. WHEN I work with different projects THEN the system SHALL support per-project Babel configuration
5. WHEN I export configurations THEN the system SHALL generate standard Babel config files that work outside the application

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with the existing editor and execution environment, so that the enhanced features work naturally with my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the enhanced transpilation THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing CodeMirror editor
2. WHEN transpilation occurs THEN it SHALL work with the existing WebContainer Runner Engine without breaking changes
3. WHEN I switch between files THEN the system SHALL maintain separate transpilation contexts for each file
4. WHEN I use AI features THEN they SHALL work with both original and transpiled code appropriately
5. WHEN I save or export code THEN the system SHALL provide options for both original and transpiled versions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-optimized transpilation, so that I can work with large codebases without experiencing delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with multiple files THEN the system SHALL cache transpilation results and only re-transpile changed files
2. WHEN transpilation occurs THEN the system SHALL use worker threads or web workers to avoid blocking the UI
3. WHEN I have large files THEN the system SHALL provide incremental transpilation for better performance
4. WHEN I use the same dependencies repeatedly THEN the system SHALL cache Babel plugin loading and configuration
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup strategies for transpilation caches

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can understand and optimize the transpilation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transpilation occurs THEN the system SHALL log timing information and performance metrics
2. WHEN I enable debug mode THEN the system SHALL show detailed Babel plugin execution and transformation steps
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive error information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN I analyze performance THEN the system SHALL provide insights into transpilation bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. WHEN I need support THEN the system SHALL generate diagnostic reports with configuration and error details
