# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RunJS Local + AI is an Electron-based desktop application that emulates and extends RunJS capabilities, providing secure local JavaScript/TypeScript code execution through WebContainer technology with integrated AI assistance. The application features a clean, modular architecture with plugin support, real-time code execution, and intelligent code generation/assistance through multiple AI providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute JavaScript/TypeScript code in a secure sandbox environment, so that I can test and experiment with code without affecting my local system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write JavaScript code in the editor THEN the system SHALL execute it in a WebContainer sandbox
2. WHEN code is executed THEN the system SHALL display real-time output in a dedicated console panel
3. WHEN code execution encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display error messages with stack traces
4. WHEN I execute code THEN the system SHALL prevent access to the host file system and system resources
5. WHEN I run multi-file projects THEN the system SHALL support virtual file system operations within the container

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intelligent code editor with syntax highlighting and AI assistance, so that I can write code efficiently with contextual help.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the application THEN the system SHALL provide a CodeMirror v6 editor with JavaScript/TypeScript syntax highlighting
2. WHEN I type code THEN the system SHALL provide real-time linting and error detection
3. WHEN I request AI assistance THEN the system SHALL provide code completion, explanation, and generation based on context
4. WHEN I work with multiple files THEN the system SHALL support tabbed interface with buffer management
5. WHEN I select code THEN the system SHALL allow AI-powered refactoring and documentation generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with AI assistants for code generation and problem-solving, so that I can accelerate my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the chat interface THEN the system SHALL connect to configured AI providers (OpenRouter, Transformers.js)
2. WHEN I ask questions about code THEN the system SHALL provide contextual responses based on current buffer content
3. WHEN I request code generation THEN the system SHALL generate functional code snippets based on natural language descriptions
4. WHEN I request code explanation THEN the system SHALL analyze and explain code functionality in plain language
5. WHEN I use AI features THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history and context across sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a plugin system to extend application functionality, so that I can customize the tool to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install a plugin THEN the system SHALL load it safely in an isolated environment
2. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide controlled access to core APIs (editor, runner, storage, AI)
3. WHEN plugin events occur THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate handlers (onRun, onBufferChange, onSave, onAIResponse)
4. WHEN I develop plugins THEN the system SHALL support loading from local directories and npm packages
5. WHEN plugins register commands THEN the system SHALL make them available through the command palette

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, so that AI assistants have rich context about my code and project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI processes requests THEN the system SHALL provide current buffer content, cursor position, and selection
2. WHEN working with projects THEN the system SHALL share file tree structure and project configuration with AI
3. WHEN AI suggests changes THEN the system SHALL apply them accurately to the correct files and locations
4. WHEN using MCP THEN the system SHALL support plug-and-play integration with compatible LLMs
5. WHEN context changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the information available to AI providers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent storage for my code, settings, and execution history, so that I can maintain my work across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write code THEN the system SHALL automatically save buffer contents and restore them on restart
2. WHEN I execute code THEN the system SHALL maintain execution history with timestamps and results
3. WHEN I configure settings THEN the system SHALL persist user preferences and plugin configurations
4. WHEN I create projects THEN the system SHALL save project structure and associated files
5. WHEN I work offline THEN the system SHALL function fully without requiring external storage services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a component generator interface, so that I can quickly create boilerplate code for different frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the generator THEN the system SHALL provide a simple interface with prompt input and framework selection
2. WHEN I specify requirements THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate component code for React, Vue, or other selected frameworks
3. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL inject results into a new file or current buffer as requested
4. WHEN using the generator THEN the system SHALL leverage AI engine capabilities for intelligent code creation
5. WHEN components are generated THEN the system SHALL include proper imports, exports, and framework-specific patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure execution environment with proper isolation, so that I can run untrusted code safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code executes THEN the system SHALL prevent access to host system resources and files
2. WHEN using WebContainer THEN the system SHALL avoid child_process, vm2, or other potentially unsafe execution methods
3. WHEN running code THEN the system SHALL contain all operations within the sandbox boundary
4. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all code before execution
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without exposing system internals

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multi-provider AI integration with fallback capabilities, so that I have reliable access to AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN primary AI provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to secondary providers
2. WHEN configuring AI THEN the system SHALL support OpenRouter, Transformers.js, AI SDK, and LangChain.js
3. WHEN using different AI features THEN the system SHALL route requests to the most appropriate provider
4. WHEN AI responses are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent interface regardless of provider
5. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL utilize local Transformers.js models when available

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern, responsive user interface, so that I can work efficiently with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clean interface inspired by RunJS and VSCode
2. WHEN resizing windows THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout with proper panel management
3. WHEN switching between features THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and consistent navigation
4. WHEN displaying output THEN the system SHALL show results in organized, readable format with syntax highlighting
5. WHEN customizing appearance THEN the system SHALL support theme configuration and layout preferences
